Prime is a simple pastebin.com interface.

Simply provide it with a list  of files and it'll take care
of the rest (sort of).


Requirements 
------------

cpanm  is   recommended  to  install   these  requirements.
https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus

- Data::Serializer
- File::HomeDir
- HTTP::Request::Common
- JSON::MaybeXS 
- LWP::UserAgent
- Term::ReadKey


Installation 
------------

Save prime.pl to a  location of your choice (usr/local/bin/
recommended), make sure it has execution rights (chmod +x),
and you're done!


Notes / Extras
--------------

To give  your paste a  specific title, add "title:"  to the
first line of  your file. Prime will use this  as the title
for pastebin,  but won't add it  to the final paste.  If no
title is  given, Prime will  default to the current  date +
epoc time.

Use "-h" or "--help" for a condensed version of this file.
